# Archetype / A New IA approach (experimental)

Some definitions:

- Concept. This is the basic atomic part of an archetype.
A concept is a gauge, from -infinite to +infinite. "0" is the "normal" concept
Example of concepts: Size, Distance, Hunger, Light, Color red, Color blue, etc.

- Archetype. A collection of concepts

- Idea. A collection of archetypes

- processor. Will process the archetypes and ideas to generate a new collection of ideas and archetypes
The processor is an inexact processor that will match parts of ideas and archetypes to process them and stats new ideas, based on recent ideas and stored ideas into memory. The generator will take part too.

- Generator. Is a concept and archetype semi-random generator, stimulated by "exterior" and "interior"

- Interior. Anything that happen into the IA

- Exterior. Any exterior sensor.

- Sensor. Any sensor to inject some concepts. Example: temperature. Pression. Sound. Sight, etc.

- Memory. A collection of ideas and archetypes stored for long term.
